            <p> My biggest project I've been working on since August of 2018. A sprite animated fighting game that takes elements from both Super Smash Bros and Mortal Kombat. This Alpha version of the game is expected to be finished in May 2018. The Alpha version will be expected to have 2 characters, 10 unique items, 1 stage, and possibly local multiplayer. I hope to get this game fully released some day, as well as improve my sprite animation to help work with bigger gaming companies.</p>
